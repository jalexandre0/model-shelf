# Task for reviewer

[Read from: /Users/jeffersonsantos/Projects/model-shelf/plan.md, /Users/jeffersonsantos/Projects/model-shelf/progress.md]

Review import command for CONVENTIONS and QUALITY.

**Use Serena tools only for code reading.**
Worker result: Output saved to: /Users/jeffersonsantos/Projects/model-shelf/.pi-subagents/artifacts/outputs/18e7bcf6-e6a9-4071-a131-f5cb3d9405ce/worker/import-result.md (3.1 KB, 62 lines). Read this file if needed.

1. Follows .serena/memories/conventions.md?
2. Anti-patterns? (unnecessary abstractions, interface with 1 impl, generic names, comments repeating code)
3. Functions < 40 lines?
4. Type hints complete?
5. Consistent with resolver.py + cli.py patterns?

Output: severity (blocker/fix-now/optional/ignore), file:line, fix. Do NOT modify files.

## Acceptance Contract
Acceptance level: attested
Completion is not accepted from prose alone. End with a structured acceptance report.

Criteria:
- criterion-1: Return concrete findings with file paths and severity when applicable

Required evidence: review-findings, residual-risks

Finish with a fenced JSON block tagged `acceptance-report` in this shape:
Use empty arrays when no items apply; array fields contain strings unless object entries are shown.
`criteriaSatisfied[].status` must be exactly one of: satisfied, not-satisfied, not-applicable.
`commandsRun[].result` must be exactly one of: passed, failed, not-run.
`manualNotes` and `notes` are optional strings; an empty string means no note and does not satisfy `manual-notes` evidence.
